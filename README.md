Develop a Skill-Sharing &amp; Learning Platform.

Cooking Mastery is an interactive web platform for food lovers to share their cooking skills, learn new techniques, and connect with others. Users can create personalized profiles, log in via OAuth 2.0, and upload media-rich posts to showcase their culinary creations. The platform supports cooking progress tracking, structured learning plans, and detailed recipe sharing. Community engagement is encouraged through likes, comments, and real-time notifications via WebSockets. With advanced search and filtering, users can easily discover relevant content. Technically, it's built with React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, offering a seamless and secure experience.
